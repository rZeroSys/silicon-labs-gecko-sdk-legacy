<ul>
<li><b>456701:</b> Fixed an issue on EFR32xG1x parts where calling <a class="el" href="group___general.html#ga6e8b6dc2c23b18768fbdba3240d864e8" title="Initialize RAIL. ">RAIL_Init()</a> with the MSC-&gt;CTRL.CLKDISFAULTEN bit set would cause a bus fault.</li>
<li><b>702377:</b> The GB868 PHYs have been modified to improve performance for the EFR32xG1, EFR32xG12, EFR32xG13 and EFR32xG14.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="anchor" id="changelist_2_8_9"></a></p><h3>2.8.9</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>645641:</b> Fixed an issue on EFR32xG22 where a state transition to receive after a transmit from EM2 sleep would drop packets.</li>
<li><b>661651:</b> Changed RAIL Timer Synchronization over sleep on the EFR32xG21 to use the RTCC instead of the PRORTC to reduce current consumption in EM2.</li>
<li><b>671168:</b> Fixed an issue on EFR32xG22 parts where current consumption would be higher than expected after radio activity.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="anchor" id="changelist_2_8_8"></a></p><h3>2.8.8</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>639833:</b> Fixed a potential radio hang on a corrupted BLE packet when doing BLE AoX.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="anchor" id="changelist_2_8_7"></a></p><h3>2.8.7</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>499216:</b> Fixed an issue with the EFR32xG21 medium power PA that could cause the output power to be too low for certain power level and ramp time combinations.</li>
<li><b>499366:</b> Added support for new BGM220 modules.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="anchor" id="changelist_2_8_6"></a></p><h3>2.8.6</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>484374:</b> Fixed regression from 2.8.1 on EFR32xG21 where BLE did not include packet sync word on PTI.</li>
<li><b>477833:</b> Some radio configurations on the EFR32XG22 are not usable with RAIL address filtering and RAIL 802.15.4 filtering. Add an assert to catch those cases.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="anchor" id="changelist_2_8_4"></a></p><h3>2.8.4</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>344182:</b> Added new <a class="el" href="group___ao_x.html#ga1c4e5be840fed86c01f7d91f60f06a22">RAIL_BLE_ConfigAoxAntenna</a> API to configure which GPIO pins are used for BLE AoX.</li>
<li><b>411017:</b> Relax constraints in RAIL to allow calling <a class="el" href="group___state___transitions.html#ga93c03ac299238d260aa46347b76989f5">RAIL_SetRxTransitions</a>, <a class="el" href="group___state___transitions.html#ga517201578ed9dae95f0088d7e76591a0">RAIL_SetTxTransitions</a>, <a class="el" href="group___receive.html#ga6da1e7a5a018eb25ea08067ad66834bb">RAIL_ScheduleRx</a>, and all of the RAIL_BLE_ConfigPhy before the radio is completely IDLE</li>
<li><b>465096:</b> Fixed an issue where <a class="el" href="group___state___transitions.html#ga5859aec2a23b30d13a3a436a551aea05">RAIL_Idle()</a> was not properly terminating an ongoing <a class="el" href="group___receive.html#gab9933d2fdec434d22737d098bb1c4f2a">RAIL_StartAverageRssi()</a> process.</li>
<li><b>467589:</b> Updated default dynamic multiprotocol (DMP) transition timings to make them work with Zigbee and BLE DMP applications work. The previously suggested workaround of adding 30us to the default transition time using <a class="el" href="group___multiprotocol.html#ga2b9d5668afa41c2fd6a3a96ca8f0a94b">RAIL_SetTransitionTime()</a> is no longer required.</li>
<li><b>471373:</b> Fixed an issue on the EFR32xG22 where loading IEEE 802.15.4 and BLE PHYs without a reset would cause an assert with error code RAIL_ASSERT_CACHE_CONFIG_FAILED.</li>
<li><b>471955:</b> Fixed an issue with BGM220 modules that caused an assert, RAIL_ASSERT_INVALID_MODULE_ACTION, when using them in previous releases.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="anchor" id="changelist_2_8_3"></a></p><h3>2.8.3</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>387749:</b> Revamped <a class="el" href="group___features.html">Features</a> and <a class="el" href="rail__features_8h.html">rail_features.h</a>, providing runtime RAIL_SupportsSomeFeature() APIs for each of the features as some features may be restricted to certain chips within a family. Also added more consistent RAIL_SUPPORTS_ compile-time synonyms for the features while retaining the existing RAIL_FEAT_ defines for backwards compatibility. These defines can now be used in C code and not just preprocessor #if statements.</li>
<li><b>442248:</b> Updated the pa_customer_curve_fits.py helper script to work with Python 3 as well as Python 2.</li>
<li><b>464735:</b> Closed tiny timing window on EFR32xG13 that might corrupt PTI appended info when idling the radio.</li>
<li><b>464774:</b> * Calling <a class="el" href="group___sleep.html#gaa1e47ba12298e3af21680d6d6fe7cfd3">RAIL_ConfigSleep()</a> with <a class="el" href="group___sleep.html#gga5156120c7894fefec8ab74bdb6a827e8ab858c29bea0a5f24d47ec3b38225893b">RAIL_SLEEP_CONFIG_TIMERSYNC_ENABLED</a> on chips that use the PRORTC for synchronization (EFR32xG13 and newer) will now only configure the choose the LF clock source if the PRORTC IRQ is disabled. This allows for other code to safely configure the PRORTC like the Silicon Labs generic sleep timer.</li>
<li><b>466396:</b> Added support for new BGM220 modules.</li>
<li><b>469015:</b> Fixed an issue on the EFR32xG21 that could cause the <a class="el" href="group___general.html#ga935e224d51f5ab0384698a540de77c0f">RAIL_GetRadioEntropy()</a> function to return the same first 4 bytes when called with the radio off after a reset.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="anchor" id="changelist_2_8_2"></a></p><h3>2.8.2</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>456338:</b> Fixed an issue with RAIL state transitions where an internal timer wrapping could cause incorrect transition times. This error would previously affect a maximum of one packet every 15 minutes.</li>
<li><b>460062:</b> Fixed a <a class="el" href="group___receive.html#ga6da1e7a5a018eb25ea08067ad66834bb">RAIL_ScheduleRx()</a> issue where <a class="el" href="group___events.html#ga46a9d13c670359ad8e39b09d0d2a801b">RAIL_EVENT_RX_SCHEDULED_RX_END</a> might not be posted when the Rx <a class="el" href="struct_r_a_i_l___state_transitions__t.html#af051cd1e90d09ad6c069ae544ca7096e">RAIL_StateTransitions_t::error</a> transition is to <a class="el" href="group___state___transitions.html#ggac15e22c67d9646e2d577a237686c9942a4a93070529fc9d2b514888ef01e5a361">RAIL_RF_STATE_IDLE</a> and the Rx window ended during receipt of an erroneous packet.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="anchor" id="changelist_2_8_1"></a></p><h3>2.8.1</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>251720:</b> Added the new <a class="el" href="group___diagnostic.html#ggaac031a73387a3b22ae8ea79279d20266aac19a4cfb0b3e881db89540f9ddb447e">RAIL_STREAM_10_STREAM</a> <a class="el" href="group___diagnostic.html#gaac031a73387a3b22ae8ea79279d20266">RAIL_StreamMode_t</a> to allow you to send a 1010 stream for debugging.</li>
<li><b>316106:</b> Added a new function, <a class="el" href="group___diagnostic.html#ga6bf1e754822648e93378e0b86c796276">RAIL_StartTxStreamAlt</a>, which allows the specific antenna to be specified for a stream transmit.</li>
<li><b>383197:</b> Added new <a class="el" href="group___receive.html#gab464660832528a499198cf503d975e58">RAIL_RX_PACKET_HANDLE_OLDEST_COMPLETE</a> packet handle to allow the user to get a reference to the oldest unreleased complete packet.</li>
<li><b>435689:</b> Added a new <a class="el" href="group___external___thermistor.html">External Thermistor</a> interface to RAIL. This allows access the user to connect and read the impedance of an external thermistor on supported chips.</li>
<li><b>444205:</b> Fixed a transmit-from-idle issue with <a class="el" href="group___transmit.html#gaa7a3edc9a902d70bf5ed54b28decb44e">RAIL_StartCcaCsmaTx()</a> or <a class="el" href="group___transmit.html#ga740714cd4ca8573abf17bf60093febbb">RAIL_StartCcaLbtTx()</a> which would always fail when the <a class="el" href="struct_r_a_i_l___state_timing__t.html#a55c862421e87e1fb61f65163564dfd18">RAIL_StateTiming_t::idleToRx</a> is configured below the minimum the radio is capable of achieving (typically 65-100 microseconds depending on platform).</li>
<li><b>450750:</b> The <a class="el" href="group___general.html#ga935e224d51f5ab0384698a540de77c0f">RAIL_GetRadioEntropy()</a> API will now ensure a valid radio configuration has been loaded using <a class="el" href="group___radio___configuration.html#ga19be74a219d6d9271db022b37639c203">RAIL_ConfigChannels()</a> since it can cause problems if the radio is used before this.</li>
<li><b>452628:</b> Fixed an issue where idling the radio from an Rx antenna diversity mode would consume extra power.</li>
<li><b>452690:</b> Fixed an issue where Rx antenna diversity could be left enabled after switching to a radio configuration that lacks diversity support.</li>
<li><b>455495:</b> Added <a class="el" href="group___i_e_e_e802__15__4.html#ga3eccc0470bce4f17be1860c6548fdc4f">RAIL_IEEE802154_ConvertRssiToEd()</a> and <a class="el" href="group___i_e_e_e802__15__4.html#ga5cf187ac3a9aed4487e982e58f5beff8">RAIL_IEEE802154_ConvertRssiToLqi()</a> to assist Zigbee 802.15.4 certification testing.</li>
<li><b>456225:</b> Changed the value of <a class="el" href="group___diagnostic___e_f_r32.html#gac453ba46510d4abcc60b86d74555cbd8">RAIL_FREQUENCY_OFFSET_INVALID</a> from -1 to -32768 since -1 is a reasonable frequency offset to pass to <a class="el" href="group___diagnostic.html#ga2154e2e6715d09ed52296d0a39d3a9c6">RAIL_SetFreqOffset()</a>. Also added convenience definitions <a class="el" href="group___diagnostic___e_f_r32.html#ga0c1fe3799f746db16e8d0e89a38ac8ec">RAIL_FREQUENCY_OFFSET_MIN</a> and <a class="el" href="group___diagnostic___e_f_r32.html#ga28cee380611f8ca810c4caa2ea50cab8">RAIL_FREQUENCY_OFFSET_MAX</a> to specify the valid range of offset values the radio supports.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="anchor" id="changelist_2_8_0"></a></p><h3>2.8.0</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>197573:</b> Suppressed extraneous <a class="el" href="group___events.html#ga0e8456d2fe62ab7b88d42f983cc0fe0b">RAIL_EVENT_TX_START_CCA</a> events that might occur during long CCA durations. Now only one such event should occur per CCA try.</li>
<li><b>295265:</b> Added two new APIs, <a class="el" href="group___radio___configuration.html#ga81be90101d1486ce2aca69c291f0175c">RAIL_GetSyncWords</a> and <a class="el" href="group___radio___configuration.html#ga1a7bb65f05b9f3a8c46c45341dc7d226">RAIL_ConfigSyncWords()</a>, to allow getting and setting the sync word configuration of your PHY at runtime.</li>
<li><b>301472:</b> On EFR32xG12 thru EFR32xG14, added support for 802.15.4G-2012 SUN PHY dynamic frame payload whitening on reception and transmit based on the PHY header's Data Whitening flag setting. This feature is automatically enabled when <a class="el" href="group___i_e_e_e802__15__4.html#ga4b473fe7294e5b80d1e05bcd843db4d1">RAIL_IEEE802154_ConfigGOptions()</a>' <a class="el" href="group___i_e_e_e802__15__4.html#ga8f1d787f0932ce4ccf9029e342fea5ad">RAIL_IEEE802154_G_OPTION_GB868</a> is enabled, and assumes the radio configuration specifies the appropriate whitening algorithm and settings.</li>
<li><b>301488:</b> On EFR32xG12 thru EFR32xG14, added support for 802.15.4G-2012 SUN PHY dynamic frame payload 2/4-byte FCS (CRC) on reception and transmit based on the PHY header's FCS Type flag setting. This feature is automatically enabled when <a class="el" href="group___i_e_e_e802__15__4.html#ga4b473fe7294e5b80d1e05bcd843db4d1">RAIL_IEEE802154_ConfigGOptions()</a>' <a class="el" href="group___i_e_e_e802__15__4.html#ga8f1d787f0932ce4ccf9029e342fea5ad">RAIL_IEEE802154_G_OPTION_GB868</a> is enabled. The radio configuration's (single) CRC algorithm settings are ignored, overridden by RAIL.</li>
<li><b>301501:</b> On EFR32xG12 thru EFR32xG14, 802.15.4 AutoACK behavior has also been updated so transmitted immediate ACKs reflect the Whitening and 2/4-byte FCS of the received frame being acknowledged.</li>
<li><b>369722:</b> Added <a class="el" href="group___transmit.html#gadec25e0c3fb99d47105d9c0f98ccca9f">RAIL_TX_OPTION_CCA_ONLY</a> to just perform CCA (CSMA/LBT), stopping short of automatically transmitting when the channel is clear.</li>
<li><b>369727:</b> Added support for a new <a class="el" href="group___events.html#ga58848f5fb6f9f4d7b04a666c186c1811">RAIL_EVENT_TX_STARTED</a>, triggered when the first preamble bit is about to go on-air. Also included the ability to retrieve the equivalent <a class="el" href="group___system___timing.html#ggac045a4bbbe318ce914084699be1a194ca3dcaead21159e5d25f842a8bf1ccf10a">RAIL_PACKET_TIME_AT_PREAMBLE_START</a> timestamp of that event from the event's handler via <a class="el" href="group___transmit.html#gacff0db9946545dd4f20b5a79bae81da5">RAIL_GetTxTimePreambleStart()</a>.

<li><b>369727:</b> Also changed <a class="el" href="group___packet___information.html#ga0659573956281a99b780f0ef00f04385">RAIL_GetRxTimePreambleStartAlt()</a>, <a class="el" href="group___packet___information.html#gaf92bdfa721a99c0e9701da29fa3064c2">RAIL_GetRxTimeSyncWordEndAlt()</a>, and <a class="el" href="group___packet___information.html#ga9e15dde69a7b8bee813ad6a7746aaa35">RAIL_GetRxTimeFrameEndAlt()</a> to properly update its pPacketDetails' <a class="el" href="struct_r_a_i_l___packet_time_stamp__t.html#ad00806c8d6537217eb06fd93d4ab0948">RAIL_PacketTimeStamp_t::timePosition</a> to reflect the adjusted <a class="el" href="struct_r_a_i_l___packet_time_stamp__t.html#a941f3619acef6f21c84a9f14b821936c">RAIL_PacketTimeStamp_t::packetTime</a> rather than leaving it as <a class="el" href="group___system___timing.html#ggac045a4bbbe318ce914084699be1a194ca5ad656646614c94a9ef34896dafedd40">RAIL_PACKET_TIME_DEFAULT</a>.</li>
<li><b>384878:</b> Clarified documentation of the <a class="el" href="group___events.html#ga4e54afa38722ebdf5fc204abfe91ad38">RAIL_EVENT_RX_ACK_TIMEOUT</a> event and <a class="el" href="struct_r_a_i_l___auto_ack_config__t.html#a715d4d9d3c2a0eb6abab5b9ea808e61f">RAIL_AutoAckConfig_t::ackTimeout</a> period which extends only to packet sync word detection of an expected ACK, not packet completion of that ACK.</li>
<li><b>397072:</b> Added an API, <a class="el" href="group___diagnostic.html#ga04dc22eb42e66ef10cb6bf432e4ac1e9">RAIL_StopInfinitePreambleTx</a>, that can stop an infinite preamble on PHYs configured to use infinite preambles.</li>
<li><b>402991:</b> Added additional information to the packet trace stream for the Z-Wave protocol to indicate what region is currently active to help with decoding.</li>
<li><b>406080:</b> Added support for RFSENSE Selective (OOK) mode for supported chips, which currently includes only EFR32xG22 devices. Please refer to RAIL internal chip specific documentation for more details.</li>
<li><b>406871:</b> Documented RAIL's internal 16-packet metadata FIFO which exists on EFR32 platforms supplementing the receive FIFO of packet data. Refer to <a class="el" href="group___data___management.html">Data Management</a> and <a class="el" href="efr32_main.html">EFR32</a> for details. Included is support for a new <a class="el" href="group___events.html#gaa45a01db984a1bbcad3f709e0b7d3a72">RAIL_EVENT_RX_FIFO_FULL</a>, triggered with any packet completion event in which the receive FIFO or packet metadata FIFO are full.

<li><b>411498:</b> <a class="el" href="group___receive.html#gab9933d2fdec434d22737d098bb1c4f2a">RAIL_StartAverageRssi()</a> now returns <a class="el" href="group___general.html#ggae0d330e2daabbf1988161b4bba1ddef3a3ddab27ab553255df061547afe90ebee">RAIL_STATUS_INVALID_STATE</a> if called when the radio is not idle, enforcing its documented behavior.</li>
<li><b>414114:</b> Added a new PA mode which will attempt to automatically choose the PA which consumes the least amount of current to reliably produce the requested output power.

<li>Fixed an issue introduced in 2.6.2 where issuing a <a class="el" href="group___state___transitions.html#ga5859aec2a23b30d13a3a436a551aea05">RAIL_Idle()</a> with mode <a class="el" href="group___state___transitions.html#ggaa259ec596f750bc0a13a7aa42a6e7e27a6ff6456de828886f77422331f09d9f75">RAIL_IDLE_FORCE_SHUTDOWN_CLEAR_FLAGS</a> could sometimes cause the receive FIFO to be corrupted and trigger a RAIL assert with code (RAIL_ASSERT_FAILED_ILLEGAL_RXLEN_ENTRY_STATUS).</li>
<li>Various bug fixes and improvements for the EFR32xG21 parts.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="anchor" id="changelist_2_6_2"></a></p><h3>2.6.2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Updated the PA curves on the EFR32xG21 chips to slightly improve transmit power accuracy.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where <a class="el" href="group___rx___channel___hopping.html#ga88140eafabf795a51512bb67f409cd02">RAIL_GetChannelHoppingRssi</a> would return an RSSI value even if receive was disabled.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where <a class="el" href="group___rx___channel___hopping.html#ga88140eafabf795a51512bb67f409cd02">RAIL_GetChannelHoppingRssi</a> would not update the RSSI value while receiving packets.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue in multiprotocol where an absolute event with a non zero slip time would always work even if scheduled in the past.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="anchor" id="changelist_2_6_1"></a></p><h3>2.6.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Resolved an issue on the EFR32xG21 platform that could cause the chip to hang when coming out of a reset if <a class="el" href="group___state___transitions.html#ga5859aec2a23b30d13a3a436a551aea05">RAIL_Idle()</a> was called at the wrong time.</li>
<li>Added <a class="el" href="group___rx___channel___hopping.html#ga88140eafabf795a51512bb67f409cd02">RAIL_GetChannelHoppingRssi</a> API to allow the user to read the RSSI from each channel when channel hopping is enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where CRC-failed packets received with <a class="el" href="group___receive.html#gafeefdd8b19b65225c5b4d4a5baf0957d">RAIL_RX_OPTION_IGNORE_CRC_ERRORS</a> would be reported with <a class="el" href="group___receive.html#gga3da234077118b1e718a992ec05d06d35ac73d3d045a45e5006a3ac5ca180d0a7d">RAIL_RX_PACKET_READY_SUCCESS</a> instead of <a class="el" href="group___receive.html#gga3da234077118b1e718a992ec05d06d35a704da2438ce8b4ccb404c020696d42de">RAIL_RX_PACKET_READY_CRC_ERROR</a> when the <a class="el" href="group___events.html#ga8d78efa55becfaca8926bc4dfedede59">RAIL_EVENT_RX_FRAME_ERROR</a> event isn't enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on the EFR32xG21 platform that caused the chip to incorrectly compute the PA ramp time at high power levels. If this happened, the ramp time would be higher than expected and cause large delays in the <a class="el" href="struct_r_a_i_l___state_timing__t.html#aa024adf160963963355a10fdd1f4653a">RAIL_StateTiming_t::rxToTx</a> time which is used for sending ACK packets.</li>

</ul>
<p><a class="anchor" id="changelist_2_6_0"></a></p><h3>2.6.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue causing the receive antenna to always be reported as antenna 0 when using receive antenna diversity.</li>
<li>Added alternative APIs for calculating receive timestamps, which give correct results for Long-Range BLE: <a class="el" href="group___packet___information.html#ga9e15dde69a7b8bee813ad6a7746aaa35">RAIL_GetRxTimeFrameEndAlt</a>, <a class="el" href="group___packet___information.html#ga0659573956281a99b780f0ef00f04385">RAIL_GetRxTimePreambleStartAlt</a>, <a class="el" href="group___packet___information.html#gaf92bdfa721a99c0e9701da29fa3064c2">RAIL_GetRxTimeSyncWordEndAlt</a>.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where receive events could corrupt the transmit packet length in frame type based length mode if they came in between the start transmit call and the actual transmit.</li>
<li>Fixed an Auto-ACK problem where ACKs were being sent for CRC error frames when <a class="el" href="group___receive.html#gafeefdd8b19b65225c5b4d4a5baf0957d">RAIL_RX_OPTION_IGNORE_CRC_ERRORS</a> is in effect.</li>
<li>Fixed a math error that could cause the <a class="el" href="struct_r_a_i_l___csma_config__t.html#aeacb0d91bd112811aa2ce6ca40a59c87">RAIL_CsmaConfig_t::ccaDuration</a> to be shorter than requested. This would happen whenever the (ccaDuration * rx_baudrate) exceeded the size of a 32 bit integer.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the multiprotocol RAIL library where the <a class="el" href="group___p_a.html#gaff0c56d3a05a05c0e973f581ab78dfc6">RAIL_GetTxPower()</a> function could return the wrong output power if called with any RAIL handle other than the active one. We will now return the actual power that would be set if that protocol is active.</li>
<li>Fixed the PA conversion code so that it better handles error conditions and will not trigger a fault when given NULL parameters.</li>
<li>Added new API to retrieve the channel index of the most recent Beam packet accepted: <a class="el" href="group___z___wave.html#gaf77c57b19de92af135ce4c9062f2e445">RAIL_ZWAVE_GetBeamChannelIndex</a>.</li>
<li>Added a new <a class="el" href="group___general.html#ga5e48d4bbe3f39306d2d20dfdc857beb5">RAIL_DelayUs()</a> API for short blocking delays using the RAIL time base.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem where state timings would not properly be updated when switching if both protocols used the same channel configuration structure.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on the EFR32xG14 series that prevented Rx antenna diversity from functioning properly. This was introduced in the RAIL 2.5.0 release.</li>
<li>Restored pre-2.5.0 behavior with <a class="el" href="group___data___management.html#ga4d8a6cbebaa4417637459ca11be63668" title="Configure the RAIL receive FIFO almost full threshold. ">RAIL_SetRxFifoThreshold()</a> to disable threshold events from occurring when passed an rxThreshold of the FIFO's size or larger. A 2.5.0 change allowed such rxThreshold settings to cause the event to fire when the buffer became full, though it's been mis-documented as one byte away from becoming full for quite a while &ndash; something that was never actually implemented and is now removed from the documentation.</li>
<li>Fixed <a class="el" href="group___transmit.html#gaa7a3edc9a902d70bf5ed54b28decb44e">RAIL_StartCcaCsmaTx()</a> and <a class="el" href="group___transmit.html#ga740714cd4ca8573abf17bf60093febbb">RAIL_StartCcaLbtTx()</a> to return <a class="el" href="group___general.html#ggae0d330e2daabbf1988161b4bba1ddef3a57e7dc36f3bfaceb0dff3a8104b3cb63">RAIL_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</a> when passed invalid configuration parameters in their respective <a class="el" href="struct_r_a_i_l___csma_config__t.html">RAIL_CsmaConfig_t</a> or <a class="el" href="struct_r_a_i_l___lbt_config__t.html">RAIL_LbtConfig_t</a>, whose documentation has been updated accordingly. In earlier releases the requested operation would proceed with an invalid or incomplete hardware configuration, resulting in undefined behavior. <hr/>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.5.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Worked around a BLE longrange problem where Rx abort could cause deafness.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.5.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added a channel hopping feature with <a class="el" href="group___rx___channel___hopping.html#gafaacae9edeb63abdd41698dedbd03995">RAIL_ConfigRxChannelHopping</a> and <a class="el" href="group___rx___channel___hopping.html#ga54631ba84c9fa46502f62e34cf82445e">RAIL_EnableRxChannelHopping</a>. This feature allows users to specify a list of channels to scan over during receive. This feature allows for much faster scanning with less delay (about 100us) than simply repeatedly calling <a class="el" href="group___receive.html#gac06e943d92be460f46b9f3c2c581377d">RAIL_StartRx()</a> with different channels.</li>
<li>Included two default transmit power curves in the library: RAIL_TxPowerCurvesDcdc and RAIL_TxPowerCurvesVbat. When the pa-conversions plugin is used, one of these can be passed to the plugin, based on the way the power amplifier is powered.</li>
<li>Added the ability to specify a Link Quality Indicator (LQI) conversion callback with <a class="el" href="group___receive.html#ga8f88abdb92679f00da48d301b7a51665">RAIL_ConvertLqi</a> such that the hardware's LQI value can be changed before application consumption of that value.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where <a class="el" href="group___diagnostic.html#gad985f53aa4aa7a1bf82630eb18eaa681">RAIL_StopTxStream()</a> was taking an extended amount of time to complete.</li>
<li>Certain received packet details in <a class="el" href="struct_r_a_i_l___rx_packet_details__t.html">RAIL_RxPacketDetails_t</a>, which were formerly available only for successfully received packets, are now also available for unsuccessfully received packets.</li>
<li><a class="el" href="group___data___management.html#gae489a8373bb6871e4b30b55d4bd8255e">RAIL_DataMethod_t</a> and related documentation have been updated to reflect that many FIFO_MODE concepts can now be used in PACKET_MODE, and the distinction between these modes has become nearly invisible for transmit. Also eliminated the previous restriction that both receive and transmit <a class="el" href="group___data___management.html#gae489a8373bb6871e4b30b55d4bd8255e">RAIL_DataMethod_t</a> must match in the <a class="el" href="struct_r_a_i_l___data_config__t.html">RAIL_DataConfig_t</a> passed to <a class="el" href="group___data___management.html#gaa56f5380ff209e1f7823567b44967de7" title="RAIL data management configuration.

<li>Added a new <a class="el" href="group___transmit.html#gafa3a6868a51c2b9035d9f0a2f9b0dd83">RAIL_TxOptions_t</a> option <a class="el" href="group___transmit.html#gaa887d34998698109746e6763fbf17cda">RAIL_TX_OPTION_CCA_PEAK_RSSI</a> to allow the user to use the peak RSSI instead of the average RSSI over the CCA period during CSMA and LBT transmits. This is only supported on EFR32xG12 and newer silicon.</li>
<li>Added a new <a class="el" href="group___transmit.html#gafa3a6868a51c2b9035d9f0a2f9b0dd83">RAIL_TxOptions_t</a> option <a class="el" href="group___transmit.html#gacc98841b4d5bdc288b20088f91d583c6">RAIL_TX_OPTION_ALT_PREAMBLE_LEN</a> to allow the user to transmit with a runtime-specified preamble length.

<li>Added <a class="el" href="group___z___wave.html">Z-Wave</a> PHY configurations and functionality to the RAIL library.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could cause register corruption in very rare conditions due to a bus access race condition. The specific registers impacted were limited to those related to the radio and the corruption was most likely when running the coherent IEEE802.15.4 PHY on the EFR32xG12 and EFR32xG13 platforms. On other platforms and PHY configurations the issue is possible though very unlikely and never observed (id: 317234).</li>
<li>Resolved a multiprotocol scheduler issue that could cause some interrupted events to not be reported to the caller. Since these events never run there are no other related events either so state machines relying on RAIL events could get stuck in invalid states (id: 341124).</li>
<li>Enhanced <a class="el" href="group___data___management.html#ga4d8a6cbebaa4417637459ca11be63668" title="Configure the RAIL receive FIFO almost full threshold. ">RAIL_SetRxFifoThreshold()</a> and <a class="el" href="group___data___management.html#ga1c78ceb2b403a74e597248d27aa44bba" title="Configure the RAIL transmit FIFO almost empty threshold.

<li>Fixed a documentation issue where a variety of RAIL APIs were incorrectly shown as "Referenced by RAIL_CopyRxPacket()". <hr/>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.4.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with <a class="el" href="group___sleep.html#ga7859226adeb8f7f47a1a9230fb56e6ad" title="Stop the RAIL timer and prepare RAIL for sleep. ">RAIL_Sleep()</a> that could cause the wake event to be set very far in the future. This would prevent waking at the proper time and cause problems for the application.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the multiprotocol library where the txToRxSearch time set by <a class="el" href="group___state___transitions.html#ga672e6c1abd9a143454bda0e48a2c88ec">RAIL_SetStateTiming()</a> would be lost after a protocol switch if there were no timings stored in the channel configuration.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue preventing radio coexistence transmit abort counter from incrementing.</li>
<li>Fixed radio coexistence HAL_CONFIG support for shared priority and shared request.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.4.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added ability to set custom receive FIFO sizes via the <a class="el" href="group___data___management.html#ga4cf7a074232bafeb00bc8ebd10a28dba" title="Set the address of the receive FIFO, a circular buffer used for RX data.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.3.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added a <a class="el" href="group___packet___information.html#ga186762efcf09906f595142db30463c0e" title="Copy a full packet to a user-specified contiguous buffer.

">RAIL_PeekRxPacket()</a>.</li>
<li>A multi-timer API was added that allows for multiple software timers all driven off the one hardware timer.

<li>Made PHY configuration improvements for BLE and Zigbee on the efr32xg14 platform. <hr/>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.2.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>In FIFO mode on the EFR32 the FIFO could only be read after 8 bytes were received. This restriction has now been lifted though the user must be careful and understand that in certain cases they could be reading appended information and not packet bytes.</li>
<li>On the EFR32XG14 some BLE packets showed up with invalid timestamps. These are now filtered and reported as aborted to the user so that the stack does not time sync to an invalid timestamp and lose the connection.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where state transition times would not be recomputed when changing the PA ramp time on the fly.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression in 2.1.1 that caused Frame Type based length configurations to lock up the receiver. There was an issue where bits in the byte that were not supposed to be a part of the frame type were being included some times and could cause problems in the receive processing logic.</li>

<li>Prevented the sync word in packet trace feature from being turned on in Zigbee when it's enabled by BLE. <hr/>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.1.2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Removed unimplemented functions RAIL_GetActiveChannelConfig() and RAIL_GetActiveChannelConfigEntry().</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.1.1</h3>
<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="group___auto___ack.html#gada501fe436ecd2e244a027707f0c5c5d">RAIL_PauseTxAutoAck()</a> was internally pausing the Rx AutoAck logic. This has now been corrected.</li>
<li>EFR32XG12 and EFR32XG13 devices were detecting a high number of false 15.4 sync words. Even though these packets were eventually filtered they would show up on PTI. In 2.1.1 there should be significantly fewer of these packets as some of this was caused by a bug in a configuration algorithm.</li>
<li>Channel power limits for BLE PHYs were not always being respected. This could have caused us to use a power which might result in certification issues.</li>
<li>The <a class="el" href="rail__chip__specific_8h.html#a2e1d2cb24822c99e057532d0fa4fdc29">RAIL_StateBuffer_t</a> type was incorrectly sized resulting in a waste of RAM for RAIL applications. This has now been trimmed down to the actual size required.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.1.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Packet receive APIs were totally revamped to allow faster and out-of-order deferred processing of received packets and their data outside of interrupt/callback context. Gone are RAIL_GetRxPacketHandle(), RAIL_ReadRxFifoAppendedInfo(), and the memory management RAILCb_ callbacks, replaced with <a class="el" href="group___packet___information.html#ga60286af35c3c6b476b3f2304ac2a38f2" title="Get basic information about a pending or received packet.

">RAIL_ReadRxFifo()</a> behavior.</li>
<li>On the transmit side, zero-copy is also now supported by allowing applications to specify their own buffers for the transmit FIFO, eliminating RAIL's former internal fixed-size 512-byte one. See new <a class="el" href="group___data___management.html#gaba67c4561ebc027318a70903c9e9daf2" title="Set the address of the transmit FIFO, a circular buffer used for TX data.

<li>The RAIL_Event_t type was renamed <a class="el" href="group___events.html#ga1559b73de83c34b15369bd0be4429a45">RAIL_Events_t</a> now that multiple events can be presented to the application simultaneously in RAIL's generic events callback, rather than relying on the internal arbitrary order that RAIL imposed previously, which may not match the application's or protocol's expectations.</li>
<li>Event/callback configuration is now managed entirely by <a class="el" href="group___events.html#gae816919876072fac753173837aef3fbe" title="Configure radio events. ">RAIL_ConfigEvents()</a>, eliminating the old RAIL_ConfigTx() and RAIL_SetCallbackConfig() APIs.</li>
<li>Channel numbers were increased in range from 8 bits to 16 bits, and channel configurations made much more flexible allowing for multi-band radio configurations and an easy way to specify TX power limits on certain channels that otherwise share a common configuration. See new APIs RAIL_GetActiveChannelConfig() and RAIL_GetActiveChannelConfigEntry() along with changes to <a class="el" href="group___radio___configuration.html#ga19be74a219d6d9271db022b37639c203" title="Configure the channels supported by this device.

<li>Protocols using Frame Types to determine packet length are better integrated into the Studio radio configurator and channel configuration. Gone are APIs like RAIL_ConfigFrameTypeLength() and RAIL_EnableAddressFilterByFrameType() whose functionality is now subsumed within channel configurations.</li>
<li>APIs to support RAIL timebase synchronization across sleep/wake were added: <a class="el" href="group___sleep.html#gaa1e47ba12298e3af21680d6d6fe7cfd3" title="Initialize RAIL timer synchronization.

<li>Support for Packet Traffic Arbitration (PTA) or Coexistence was added in the form of an API to prevent transmits from going on the air: <a class="el" href="group___transmit.html#ga9ad0ed88c2c7d782b9098ed7d7b16ab3" title="Prevent the radio from starting a transmit.

<h3>1.6.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added new BLE radio configurations for EFR32xG13 parts to fix a transmit overshoot issue on the coded PHY configurations for BLE Long Range.</li>
<li>Fixed DCDC voltage droop during RAIL_RfInit()</li>
<li>Added an API (<a class="el" href="group___calibration.html#ga2c0308276c5f350278d87cc825b5cabb" title="Enable/disable the PA calibration. ">RAIL_EnablePaCal()</a>) that enables loading of chip to chip PA calibration data.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.6.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where RAIL_RfStateGet() would mistakenly return RAIL_RF_STATE_IDLE instead of RAIL_RF_STATE_TX when a Transmit operation's LBT is active.</li>
<li>Added an API (RAIL_SetAbortScheduledTxDuringRx) that sets the behavior when a scheduled TX fires during an RX or ACK. If the API is passed false, TX's will be delayed until the RX (or ACK to the RX) is complete. That behavior is the default and what always happened previously. Passing the function true however will abort scheduled TX's that fire during the RX (or ACK to the RX) and fire the RAILCb_TxRadioStatus callback.</li>
<li>Added new RAILCb_AssertFailed callback to give the flexible handling of asserts within RAIL. This includes defines of assert codes and error reasons in <a class="el" href="rail__assert__error__codes_8h.html" title="Definition of error codes that occur in rail for use in RAILCb_AssertFailed. ">rail_assert_error_codes.h</a>. The default implementation hangs in an infinite loop.</li>

<li>Added new TX options: removeCrc, to override whether CRC is sent; and syncWordId, to choose which SYNC word to transmit when multiple SYNC words are configured.</li>
<li>Added new RX option: RAIL_RX_OPTION_ENABLE_DUALSYNC, which allows multiple SYNC words to be searched for on PHYs that support it.</li>
<li>Added RAIL_PeekRxPacket to allow reading part of a packet before it has been fully received.</li>
<li>Changed BER Test functionality in RAILTest such that if a RX overflow is detected (due to the incoming datarate being too high), the test now aborts and displays an appropriate status message.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the code could hang in a RX overflow state when receiving incoming data streams.</li>
<li>RAIL_TxToneStart() and RAIL_TxStreamStart() now idle the radio before transmitting.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where calling RAIL_TimerSet() while in the middle of a stream or tone transmission could lock up the radio.</li>
<li>Added new frequency offset related functions, RAIL_GetRxFreqOffset and RAIL_SetFreqOffset, and the associated RAIL_FrequencyOffset_t type definition. <hr/>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.5.2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in 1.5.1 that would cause scheduled receive, scheduled transmit, and RAIL timer operations to fail on EFR32xG12 with a relative delay of 0.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in 1.5.1 that would cause scheduled receive and scheduled transmit to fail if called with an absolute time from [0, rxWarmTime) or [0, txWarmTime) respectively.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a failed scheduled transmit operation would prevent any transmit from succeeding until RAIL_RfIdle() or RAIL_RfIdleExt() were called.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in 1.5.1 where calling idle while looking for an ACK could cause the radio to get stuck in the receive state.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.5.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added official support for the EFR32xG12 parts through a new librail_efr32xg12.a version of the library.</li>
<li>Added RAIL_SetRxOptions API for configuration of receive options, such as RAIL_RX_OPTION_STORE_CRC.</li>
<li>Increase transmit and receive fifo sizes to 512 bytes for all EFR32xG1 parts. This impacts both packet and fifo modes.</li>
<li>Added <a class="el" href="group___data___management.html#gga16584c741da74d9fa7bfb6c6b74012b9a3680d24c321ca9595f80f4062284de82">RAIL_RxDataSource_t::RX_DEMOD_DATA</a> in order to receive demodulated data via FIFO method.</li>
<li>Shortened the duration that the transmit buffer lock in RAIL_TxDataLoad() is held, as it was overprotective. RAIL will still report an error if the application attempts to manipulate the transmit buffer while actively transmitting data.</li>
<li>Improved state transition timings for enhanced precision and accuracy. To improve precision we have switched to a more stable receive complete event since our previous trigger could jitter for certain radio configurations. To improve accuracy we measured and removed PHY specific overhead for BLE applications. Note that this measurement was BLE specific and does <em>not</em> completely correct accuracy on any arbitrary PHY configuration. For custom PHY configurations you will still have to manually calibrate out any offsets by measurement and any previous measurements are likely different now.</li>
<li>Moved BER test implementation out of the RAIL library and into RAILTest. Deprecated the existing BER test functions in the RAIL API. With BER test code now existing in RAILTest, you must use version 2.2.1 or later of the radio configurator.</li>
<li>Disabled receive buffer overflow and transmit buffer underflow as <a class="el" href="group___e_f_r32x_g1x___interrupts.html#gaf0715f354743cd91d25299840842a730" title="RAIL interrupt handler for the BUFC interrupt source. ">BUFC_IRQHandler()</a> events. These events now only occur in <a class="el" href="group___e_f_r32x_g1x___interrupts.html#ga0c7a131a40ec0f4f4aedbdad5f15b399" title="RAIL interrupt handler for the FRC interrupt source. ">FRC_IRQHandler()</a>.</li>
<li>Sped up RAIL transmit and receive buffer read/write operations.</li>
<li>Fixed a race condition that could cause the receive packet callback to be delayed until the next receive packet event.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.5.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added other methods of <a class="el" href="group___data___management.html">Data Management</a>. The application can configure RAIL to provide/retrieve data via FIFO method.</li>
<li>The new FIFO method of data management brings with it two new callbacks: RAILCb_TxFifoAlmostEmpty(), and RAILCb_RxFifoAlmostFull(). Note that you must implement these new callbacks or stub them out if you do not intend to use them. <hr/>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.4.2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in how we handled IEEE 802.15.4 data request packets. Specifically, we were not issuing the RAILCb_IEEE802154_DataRequestCommand() callback for data request packets that were sent with MAC security enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where calling RAIL_TxDataLoad() at an inopportune time could cause that and all subsequent such calls to fail.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.4.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Implemented LQI measurement. The field in RAIL_AppendedInfo_t is now populated on every packet receive.</li>
<li>Allow transmit while receive is active, if the channel is the same. After transmitting, the radio will follow the configured state transitions as before.</li>
<li>Allow shorter ccaBackoff times if receive is active during the CSMA or LBT process.</li>
<li>Allow calling RAIL_RxConfig while receiving.</li>
<li>Added new receive event: RAIL_RX_CONFIG_PACKET_ABORTED</li>
<li>Added new RAIL_TxConfig API, along with more transmit events: RAIL_TX_CONFIG_CHANNEL_CLEAR, RAIL_TX_CONFIG_CCA_RETRY, RAIL_TX_CONFIG_START_CCA</li>
<li>Fixed a filtering bug in the IEEE 802.15.4 code. We were incorrectly filtering packets with a 0xFFFF source PANID while the coordinator which caused problems in the joining process. The new logic will only use the source PANID for filtering if we are the coordinator, there is no destination address, and the frame type is MAC command or Data.</li>
<li>Migrated to Gecko SDK 5.0, including the new em_core APIs for interrupt enabling and disabling. This adds required dependencies on the CORE_EnterCritical() and CORE_ExitCritical() functions.</li>
<li>Added new RSSI functions for hardware and software averaging: RAIL_StartAverageRSSI(), RAIL_GetAverageRSSI(), RAIL_AverageRSSIReady(), RAIL_PollAverageRSSI().</li>
<li>Added new RSSI callback: RAILCb_RssiAverageDone().</li>
<li>Added the ability to switch between multiple BLE phys, including 2Mbps phys, on chips that support the new phys.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.4.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added support for the EFR32MG12P part family with larger RAM and Flash size variants along with some new chip features.</li>
<li>Renamed anything that was just efr32 in the previous releases to efr32xg1 to differentiate it from the new efr32xg12 family of parts.</li>
<li>Add support for the new BLE 2MBit PHY to the BLE acceleration and configuration APIs on EFR32xG12 chips.</li>
<li>Better optimize IR Calibration run times for all EFR32xG1 parts. You must use version 0.69 or later of the radio configurator. <hr/>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.3.2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added <a class="el" href="group___p_t_i.html#ga5c775503305543b03ab9c5233060defa" title="Set a protocol that RAIL outputs on PTI. ">RAIL_SetPtiProtocol()</a> and <a class="el" href="group___p_t_i.html#ga393796f90b11560f461191305ee84980">RAIL_PtiProtocol_t</a>. This function allows the application to configure RAIL's packet trace interface to output protocol specific data.</li>
<li>Fix BER functions to operate at 1Mbps data rates.</li>
<li>RAIL_RfIdle() does not clear the transmit buffer anymore. RAIL_TxDataLoad() resets the transmit buffer with every packet set. This fixes the case where RAIL_RfIdle() is called after RAIL_TxDataLoad().</li>
<li>Fixed bug when using fixed packet lengths configured via the Radio Configurator. RAIL_TxStart() will not overwrite the configured fixed length to the amount of data loaded by RAIL_TxDataLoad().</li>
<li>Fixed bug in RADIO_PA_Init() where ramp times greater than 11.2 ms would be truncated to a very short ramp.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.3.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added IEEE 802.15.4 hardware acceleration. The new APIs can be found in <a class="el" href="rail__ieee802154_8h.html" title="The IEEE 802.15.4 specific header file for the RAIL library.

<li>Added an extended idle function which gives you more control of how the radio is idled. See RAIL_RfIdleExt() and RAIL_RfIdleMode_t for more details.</li>
<li>Added RAIL_RX_CONFIG_TIMEOUT and RAIL_RX_CONFIG_SCHEDULED_RX_END</li>
<li>Added RAIL_TX_CONFIG_TX_ABORTED and RAIL_TX_CONFIG_TX_BLOCKED</li>
<li>Added an extended radio status callback that supports up to 32 different status reasons (RAILCb_RxRadioStatusExt()). You may implement this instead of RAILCb_RxRadioStatus() or continue using the old version if you do not need access to more than the first 8 status values. <hr/>

<h3>1.2.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Allow RAIL_RxStart() and RAIL_TxStart() to not error if the radio is heading to idle after a call to RAIL_RfIdle(). Application code does not have to wait until the radio is completely idle before calling a receive or transmit operation as long as the radio is heading to idle.</li>

<ul>
<li>RAIL_RX_CONFIG_INVALID_CRC changed to RAIL_RX_CONFIG_FRAME_ERROR<ul>
<li>This now accurately represents the callback flag.</li>
<li>A frame error is either an invalid crc, a frame coding error, or a variable length error. On detection of a frame error, the radio will proceed to the defined error state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
